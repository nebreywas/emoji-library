x`x# Upgrade Process Notes

This document captures the step-by-step process, commands, warnings, and solutions for upgrading a Next.js project with Tailwind CSS and daisyUI. Use this as a template for future upgrades.

---

## Step 1: Preparation

- Ensure all code is committed and pushed to a remote branch.
- Review `package.json` for current versions of Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and daisyUI.
- Confirm the app builds and runs before starting the upgrade.

---

## Step 2: Upgrade Next.js and React

**Commands run:**
```sh
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```
If using TypeScript:
```sh
npm install --save-dev @types/react@latest @types/react-dom@latest
```
If using ESLint with Next.js:
```sh
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-next@latest
```

**Warnings encountered:**
```
npm warn ERESOLVE overriding peer dependency
npm warn While resolving: next-platform@1.0.0
npm warn Found: react@18.2.0
npm warn node_modules/react
npm warn   peer react@"^18.2.0" from react-dom@18.2.0
npm warn   node_modules/react-dom
npm warn     react-dom@"19.1.0" from the root project
npm warn     1 more (next)
npm warn   2 more (the root project, next)
npm warn
npm warn Could not resolve dependency:
npm warn peer react@"^18.2.0" from react-dom@18.2.0
npm warn node_modules/react-dom
npm warn   react-dom@"19.1.0" from the root project
npm warn   1 more (next)

added 156 packages, and audited 157 packages in 11s

40 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

**Explanation:**
- These warnings indicate that some dependencies (e.g., `next-platform@1.0.0`) expect React 18, but the project is now using React 19.
- As long as the app builds and runs, and no runtime errors are observed, it is safe to proceed.
- Monitor for issues in components that depend on these packages, and check for updates to those packages in the future.

## Step 3: Upgrade Tailwind CSS to v4

**Preparation:**
- Uninstall daisyUI to avoid plugin conflicts:
  ```sh
  npm uninstall daisyui
  ```
- Remove daisyUI from the `plugins` array and any `daisyui` config blocks in `tailwind.config.js`.

**Upgrade Tailwind CSS and PostCSS:**
```sh
npm install tailwindcss@latest @tailwindcss/postcss@latest
```

**Update PostCSS config:**
- In `postcss.config.js` (or `.mjs`):
  ```js
  module.exports = {
    plugins: {
      '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    },
  };
  // or, for ESM:
  export default {
    plugins: {
      '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    },
  };
  ```

**Update global CSS import:**
- In `styles/globals.css` (or your main CSS file):
  ```css
  /*
    Upgraded for Tailwind CSS v4:
    - Replaced old Tailwind directives with the new import syntax.
    - See upgrade-process-notes.md for details.
  */
  @import "tailwindcss";
  ```
- Remove any `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, or `@tailwind utilities;` lines.

**Test:**
- Run `npm run dev` and check for build errors or missing styles.

---

## Step 4: Upgrade and Reintegration of daisyUI v5+

**Install latest daisyUI:**
```sh
npm install daisyui@latest
```

**Register daisyUI using the new plugin syntax:**
- In your main CSS file (e.g., `styles/globals.css`):
  ```css
  @import "tailwindcss";
  @plugin "daisyui" {
    themes: all;
  }
  ```
- This enables all daisyUI themes. You can now use any theme via the `data-theme` attribute or theme switchers.

**Remove daisyUI from `tailwind.config.js`:**
- Do NOT add daisyUI to the `plugins` array or config blocks in `tailwind.config.js`.

**Test:**
- Run `npm run dev` and verify that daisyUI components and all themes work as expected.
- Check for any errors or warnings in the terminal and browser.

---

## Step 5: Test and Validate

- Visit all major pages/components, especially those using daisyUI.
- Try switching between daisyUI themes.
- Document any issues and how you fixed them.

---

## Summary & Checklist for Future Projects

1. **Preparation:** Commit code, review dependencies, ensure a working baseline.
2. **Upgrade Next.js/React:** Upgrade core framework and resolve peer warnings.
3. **Remove daisyUI:** Uninstall and remove from config before Tailwind upgrade.
4. **Upgrade Tailwind CSS:** Install latest Tailwind and update PostCSS and CSS imports.
5. **Reinstall daisyUI:** Install latest daisyUI and register via CSS plugin syntax, enabling all themes.
6. **Test thoroughly:** Check for errors, broken components, and theme switching.
7. **Document everything:** Record commands, config/code changes, warnings, and solutions.

---

**Outcome:**
- The upgrade was successful. All daisyUI themes are available and the app works as expected with the latest Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and daisyUI.
- This process can be reused for other projects.
