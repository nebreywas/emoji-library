# UI Glossary: DaisyUI & Tailwind Mapping

> **AI/Automation Note:** This glossary is intended for both human and AI coding agents. When in doubt, prefer the mappings and conventions here over ad-hoc class combinations.

This glossary maps common UI intent or design commands to the appropriate DaisyUI/Tailwind classes or attributes. The goal is to reduce ambiguity, increase semantic standardization, and help both humans and AI coding agents translate design intent into code with minimal errors.

> Anything referring to "base" or "base-" such as "base table" or "base button" means to use the base class names described in [`globals.css`](../styles/globals.css)

## Examples of "base" class terms ##

This list provides examples of how to use "base" class terms in conjunction with DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS. These examples are not exhaustive but illustrate common patterns for applying consistent styling across UI components.

| Component Base Term      | Class Combination                                      | Description                                             |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Checkbox base            | `checkbox` + [`app-checkbox-base`](../styles/globals.css) | Used for styling checkboxes with consistent appearance. |
| Toggle base              | `toggle` + [`app-toggle-base`](../styles/globals.css) | Used for styling toggle switches with a unified look.   |
| Radio base               | `radio` + [`app-radio-base`](../styles/globals.css) | Used for styling radio buttons consistently.            |
| Tab base                 | `tab` + [`app-tab-base`](../styles/globals.css) | Used for styling tabs with a cohesive design.           |

## üß≠ Usage Guidelines

**How to use this glossary:**
- When a spec or comment contains ambiguous UI terminology (e.g. "ghost button", "zebra row", "toast"), refer to this document.
- Align both code implementation and written design/engineering communication with these terms.
- Expand this list as new DaisyUI patterns or custom extensions emerge.
- Expand this list if you encounter difference between your understanding of terminology and your collaborators

**Purpose:**
- Reduce ambiguity for both human and AI developers.
- Encourage consistent, spec-compliant UI implementation.
- Make onboarding and code review easier.
